### This blockchain technology is for coin creators who don't want to fork a major coin like Bitcoin as their starting point. You might want to do this if:

✅  You would rather work in JavaScript than C++

✅  You are looking for a modern, simple, web-ready blockchain

✅  You don't need all the bells & whistles that Bitcoin (& others) have

✅  You want more control over the tech so you can easily add/remove features

✅  You want something easy and straightforward so you can focus on your project
